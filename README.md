# Hiragana to Katakana User Script

## Synopsis

A user script that converts all hiragana on every site to the equivalent katakana.

## Motivation

I created this to help me get more practice reading katakana.

## Usage

The user script is available at:
<https://lfire.net/user-scripts/hiragana-to-katakana.user.js>

When installed, it will automatically replace all hiragana on every page you
visit with the equivalent katakana. To disable it, simply disable the user
script.

## Building

Requires:

* make
* curl
* Python 2.7

To build, simply:

    $ make

The user script will be built as `hiragana-to-katakana.user.js`.
